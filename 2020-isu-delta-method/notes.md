Bob asked me to give a lecture on the delta method and the msm R package in a class he is teaching

Bob's phone number: 605-212-1328

Details on the course:

- ecology 607 mark recapture
- MWF from 11-11:50
- teaching in person

What to talk about:

- a little bit of background on the delta method
- could include a bit of math but don't dwell on it
- introduce the msm package and how to use it
- talk about going from one parametrization to another
- could start with monthly data and then switch to yearly data

To do:

- decide how long I want to talk for (half or all of class)
- decide on a date (probably early November)
