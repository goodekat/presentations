# Machine Learning

Machine learning models may provide magical predictions,...

&lt;img src="./figures/wizard-cat.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Black Box Models

...but being able to explain how many machine learning models produce the predictions is not an easy task.

# Literature on Explanability

**General trends I've noticed:**

- Mnay recent (last 5 years)

- Often machine learning and computer science perspectives

- Many Eurpoean authors
  - [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) (GDPR) implemented in 2018
  - [Goodman and Flaxman (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08813): "It is reasonable to suppose that any adequate explanation would, at a minimum, provide an account of how input features relate to predictions, allowing one to answer questions such as: Is the model more or less likely to recommend a loan if the applicant is a minority?"

**Key resource for this talk:**

- [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) by Christoph Molnar
- Corresponding R package: [iml](https://github.com/christophM/iml)

# Definitions and Philosophical Aspects

# Explainability versus Interpretability

I have not found agreed upon definitions.

**[Interpretable Machine Learning (Molnar 2020)](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)**

- "I will use both the terms **interpretable** and **explainable** interchangeably"
- "I will use “**explanation**” for explanations of individual predictions."

**[Methods for Interpreting and Understanding Deep Neural Networks (Montavon, Samek, and Muller 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07979.pdf)**

- "**post-hoc interpretability**, i.e. a trained model is given and our goal is to understand what the model predicts (e.g. categories) in terms what is readily interpretable (e.g. the input variables)"
- "Post-hoc interpretability should be contrasted to incorporating **interpretability directly** into the structure of the model..."
- "...when using the word “**understanding**”, we refer to a functional understanding of the model, in contrast to a lower-level mechanistic or algorithmic understanding of it."
- also distinguish between **interpretation** and **explanation**

# Explainability versus Interpretability

**[The Mythos of Model Interpretability (Lipton 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03490.pdf)**

- Paper dedicated to the philosophical discussion of what interpretability is in machine learning

**[Explaining Explanations: An Overview of Interpretability of Machine Learning (Gilpin et. al. 2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00069.pdf)**

- "We take the stance that **interpretability** alone is insufficient.
In order for humans to trust black-box methods, we need **explainability** – models that are able to summarize the reasons for neural network behavior, gain the trust of users, or produce insights about the causes of their decisions"
- Implies that you need both interpretability and explainability?

# Explainability versus Interpretability

My definitions (based on a conversation with **[Nick Street](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/nick-street)** (University of Iowa))...

.pull-left[
**Interpretability** = the ability to directly use the parameters of a model to understand the mechanism of how the model makes predictions

- a linear model coefficient: indicates the amount the response variable changes based on a change in the predictor variable
  
&lt;br&gt;

$$\hat{y}=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1x_1+\cdots+\hat{\beta}_px_p $$
]

.pull-right[
**Explainability** = the ability to use the model in an indirect manner to understand the relationships in the data captured by the mode

- LIME: model agnostic method that uses a surrogate model

&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

# Should we explain black-box models?

[**Stop Explaining Black Box Machine Learning Models for High Stakes Decisions and Use Interpretable Models Instead**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10154.pdf) by [**Cynthia Rudin**](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/):

- Debunks the “accuracy-interpretability trade-off” myth

&lt;img src="./figures/trade-off.png" width="25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- "Explanations must be wrong. They cannot have perfect fidelity with respect to the original model. If the explanation was completely faithful to what the original model computes, the explanation would equal the original model..."

- "...it is possible that the explanation leaves out so much information that it makes no sense."

- Rudin has worked on machine learning models with natural interpretability

.pull-left[
**Advantages**

- Can be applied to any model

- Convenient if comparing various types of predictive models

- Visualization or model based approach

&lt;br&gt;

**Disadvantages**

- Must work with any model

# Partial Dependence Plots .tiny[[Friedman 2001](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1013203451)]

**Purpose**: Visualize marginal relationship between one (or two) predictors and model predictions

**Estimated partial dependence function:**

`$$\hat{f}_{x_{int}}(x_{int})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\hat{f}(x_{int},x^{(i)}_{other})$$`

- `\(\hat{f}=\)` machine learning model fit using predictor variables 
- `\(x_{int}=\)` value of the predictor of interest
- `\(x^{(i)}_{other}=\)` vector of training data values of other predictors in the model for observation `\(i\)`

# Individual Conditional Expectation .tiny[[Goldstein et. al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6392.pdf)]

**Purpose**: Similar to partial dependence plots, but consider each observation separately instead of taking an average.

**Estimated individual conditional expectation function:**

`$$\hat{f}^{(i)}_{x_{int}}(x_{int})=\hat{f}(x_{int},x^{(i)}_{other})$$`

- `\(\hat{f}=\)` machine learning model fit using predictor variables 
- `\(x_{int}=\)` value of the predictor of interest

# Centered ICE Plots

"Sometimes it can be hard to tell whether the ICE curves differ between individuals because they start at different predictions. A simple solution is to center the curves at a certain point in the feature and display only the difference in the prediction to this point." - Molnar

# Permutation Feature Importance

**Background**

- Idea originally proposed by [Brieman (2001)](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf) for random forests

- Adapted to be used with all models by [Fisher, Rudin, and Dominici (2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01489v1.pdf)

  - Call this measure the model class reliance

**Concept**

- Measure feature importance by seeing how much the prediction error is affected when a feature is permuted
  
  - important feature: one that affects the prediction error when changed
  
  - non-important feature: one that does not affect the prediction error when changed

# Permutation Feature Importance in iml

**Permutation feature importance of bike data random forest**
  
.left-code[

```r
# Create the predictor 
# (seemingly FeatureImp 
# requires y)
bike_pred = 
* Predictor$new(
    model = bike_mod, 
    data = bike, 
    y = bike$cnt)

# Compute the feature
# importance values
bike_imp = 
* FeatureImp$new(
    predictor = bike_pred, 
    loss = 'mae')

# Plot the feature
# importance values
*plot(bike_imp)
```

.pull-left[
Introduce three measures for feature importance: 

**Individual Conditional Importance (ICI)**

- "local" permutation feature importance metric 
- similar to ICE plots but "visualize the expected (conditional) feature importance instead of the expected (conditional)" prediction"

**Partial Importance (PI)**

- aggregate of ICI values

**Shapely Feature Importance (SFIMP)**

- based on shapely values

# Global Surrogate Models

.pull-left[
**Idea**: Use an interpretable model to explain a black-box model

**Procedure**:

1. Train a black-box model

2. Obtain predictions from black-box model on a set of data (training data or other)

3. Fit an interpretable model (linear regression model, tree, etc)

.center[black-box predictions ~ predictor variables]
  
**Cautions**: How to know if the global surrogate is a good enough approximation of the complex model?

# Local Surrogate Model: LIME

**LIME** = Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations

- Consider one prediction of interest
- Use a surrogate model to explain the black-box model in a "local" region about a point of interest

**Example-Based Explanations**

- Counterfactual Examples
  - Laugel et. al. 2019: "A counterfactual explanation is thus a data instance, close to this observation, that is predicted to belong to a different class. This form of explanation provides a user tangible explanations that are directly understandable and actionable, which can be seen as an advantage."

# A Cautionary Conclusion

# Concerns with LIME

# Concerns with counterfactual examples

Laugel et. al. (2019) paper:

"Several troublesome issues have been identified: [Baehrens et al., 2010] e.g. notice that modeling the decision function of a black-box classifier with a surrogate model trained on generated instances can result in explanation vectors that point in the wrong directions in some areas of the feature space in a trivial problem. The stability of post-hoc explainer systems has been criticized as well, showing that some of these approaches are locally not stable enough [Alvarez Melis and Jaakkola, 2018] or on the contrary too stable and thus not locally accurate enough [Laugel et al., 2018b]."
