# Machine Learning

Machine learning models may provide magical predictions,...

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("./figures/wizard-cat.jpg")
```

# Black Box Models

...but being able to explain how many machine learning models produce the predictions is not an easy task.

# Definitions and Philosophical Aspects

# Explainability versus Interpretability

So many definitions...

**[Interpretable Machine Learning (Molnar 2020)](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)**

- "I will use both the terms **interpretable** and **explainable** interchangeably"
- "I will use “**explanation**” for explanations of individual predictions."

**[Methods for Interpreting and Understanding Deep Neural Networks (Montavon, Samek, and Muller 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07979.pdf)**

- "**post-hoc interpretability**, i.e. a trained model is given and our goal is to understand what the model predicts (e.g. categories) in terms what is readily interpretable (e.g. the input variables)"
- "Post-hoc interpretability should be contrasted to incorporating **interpretability directly** into the structure of the model..."
- "...when using the word “**understanding**”, we refer to a functional understanding of the model, in contrast to a lower-level mechanistic or algorithmic understanding of it."
- also distinguish between **interpretation** and **explanation**

# Explainability versus Interpretability

**[The Mythos of Model Interpretability (Lipton 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03490.pdf)**

- A whole paper dedicated to the philosophical discussion of what interpretability is in machine learning

**[Explaining Explanations: An Overview of Interpretability of Machine Learning (Gilpin et. al. 2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00069.pdf)**

- "We take the stance that **interpretability** alone is insufficient.
In order for humans to trust black-box methods, we need **explainability** – models that are able to summarize the reasons for neural network behavior, gain the trust of users, or produce insights about the causes of their decisions"
- Implies that you need both interpretability and explainability?

# Explainability versus Interpretability

My definitions (based on a conversation with **[Nick Street](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/nick-street)** (University of Iowa))...

.pull-left[
**Interpretability** = the ability to directly use the parameters of a model to understand the mechanism of how the model makes predictions

- a linear model coefficient: indicates the amount the response variable changes based on a change in the predictor variable
  
<br>

$$\hat{y}=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1x_1+\cdots+\hat{\beta}_px_p $$
]

.pull-right[
**Explainability** = the ability to use the model in an indirect manner to understand the relationships in the data captured by the mode

- LIME: model agnostic method that uses a surrogate model

```{r fig.cap = "Figure from LIME paper (Ribeiro 2016)"}
include_graphics("./figures/lime.png")
```

]

# Should we explain black-box models?

[**Stop Explaining Black Box Machine Learning Models for High Stakes Decisions and Use Interpretable Models Instead**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10154.pdf) by [**Cynthia Rudin**](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/):

- Debunks the “accuracy-interpretability trade-off” myth

```{r out.width = "25%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("./figures/trade-off.png")
```

- "Explanations must be wrong. They cannot have perfect fidelity with respect to the original model. If the explanation was completely faithful to what the original model computes, the explanation would equal the original model..."

- "...it is possible that the explanation leaves out so much information that it makes no sense."

- Rudin has worked on machine learning models with natural interpretability

# Counterfactual Examples 

Laugel et. al. 2019: "A counterfactual explanation is thus a data instance, close to this observation, that is predicted to belong to a different class. This form of explanation provides a user tangible explanations that are directly understandable and actionable, which can be seen as an advantage."

# Concerns with counterfactual examples

Laugel et. al. (2019) paper:

"Several troublesome issues have been identified: [Baehrens et al., 2010] e.g. notice that modeling the decision function of a black-box classifier with a surrogate model trained on generated instances can result in explanation vectors that point in the wrong directions in some areas of the feature space in a trivial problem. The stability of post-hoc explainer systems has been criticized as well, showing that some of these approaches are locally not stable enough [Alvarez Melis and Jaakkola, 2018] or on the contrary too stable and thus not locally accurate enough [Laugel et al., 2018b]."
