# Literature on Explanability

**General trends I've noticed:**

- Mnay recent (last 5 years)

- Often machine learning and computer science perspectives

- Many Eurpoean authors
  - [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) (GDPR) implemented in 2018
  - [Goodman and Flaxman (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08813): "It is reasonable to suppose that any adequate explanation would, at a minimum, provide an account of how input features relate to predictions, allowing one to answer questions such as: Is the model more or less likely to recommend a loan if the applicant is a minority?"

**Key resource for this talk:**

- [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) by Christoph Molnar
- Corresponding R package: [iml](https://github.com/christophM/iml)

# Definitions and Philosophical Aspects

# Explainability versus Interpretability

I have not found agreed upon definitions.

**[Interpretable Machine Learning (Molnar 2020)](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)**

- "I will use both the terms **interpretable** and **explainable** interchangeably"
- "I will use “**explanation**” for explanations of individual predictions."

**[Methods for Interpreting and Understanding Deep Neural Networks (Montavon, Samek, and Muller 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07979.pdf)**

- "**post-hoc interpretability**, i.e. a trained model is given and our goal is to understand what the model predicts (e.g. categories) in terms what is readily interpretable (e.g. the input variables)"
- "Post-hoc interpretability should be contrasted to incorporating **interpretability directly** into the structure of the model..."
- "...when using the word “**understanding**”, we refer to a functional understanding of the model, in contrast to a lower-level mechanistic or algorithmic understanding of it."
- also distinguish between **interpretation** and **explanation**

---

# Explainability versus Interpretability

**[The Mythos of Model Interpretability (Lipton 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03490.pdf)**

- Paper dedicated to the philosophical discussion of what interpretability is in machine learning

**[Explaining Explanations: An Overview of Interpretability of Machine Learning (Gilpin et. al. 2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00069.pdf)**

- "We take the stance that **interpretability** alone is insufficient.
In order for humans to trust black-box methods, we need **explainability** – models that are able to summarize the reasons for neural network behavior, gain the trust of users, or produce insights about the causes of their decisions"
- Implies that you need both interpretability and explainability?

---

# Explainability versus Interpretability

My definitions (based on a conversation with **[Nick Street](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/nick-street)** (University of Iowa))...

.pull-left[
**Interpretability** = the ability to directly use the parameters of a model to understand the mechanism of how the model makes predictions

- a linear model coefficient: indicates the amount the response variable changes based on a change in the predictor variable
  
<br>

$$\hat{y}=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1x_1+\cdots+\hat{\beta}_px_p $$
]

.pull-right[
**Explainability** = the ability to use the model in an indirect manner to understand the relationships in the data captured by the mode

- LIME: model agnostic method that uses a surrogate model

```{r fig.cap = "Figure from LIME paper (Ribeiro 2016)"}
include_graphics("./figures/lime.png")
```

# Should we explain black-box models?

[**Stop Explaining Black Box Machine Learning Models for High Stakes Decisions and Use Interpretable Models Instead**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10154.pdf) by [**Cynthia Rudin**](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/):

- Debunks the “accuracy-interpretability trade-off” myth

```{r out.width = "25%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("./figures/trade-off.png")
```

- "Explanations must be wrong. They cannot have perfect fidelity with respect to the original model. If the explanation was completely faithful to what the original model computes, the explanation would equal the original model..."

- "...it is possible that the explanation leaves out so much information that it makes no sense."

- Rudin has worked on machine learning models with natural interpretability

# Partial Dependence Plots .tiny[[Friedman 2001](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1013203451)]

**Purpose**: Visualize marginal relationship between one (or two) predictors and model predictions

**Estimated partial dependence function:**

$$\hat{f}_{x_{int}}(x_{int})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\hat{f}(x_{int},x^{(i)}_{other})$$

- $\hat{f}=$ machine learning model fit using predictor variables 
- $x_{int}=$ value of the predictor of interest
- $x^{(i)}_{other}=$ vector of training data values of other predictors in the model for observation $i$

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 2.5}
# Based on code from Molnar's IML GitHub repo
bike_pred = Predictor$new(bike_mod, data = bike)
pdp = FeatureEffect$new(bike_pred, "temp", method = "pdp") 
p1 = pdp$plot() +  
  scale_x_continuous('Temperature', limits = c(0, NA)) + 
  scale_y_continuous('Predicted number of bikes', limits = c(0, 5500))
pdp$set.feature("hum")
p2 = pdp$plot() + 
  scale_x_continuous('Humidity', limits = c(0, NA)) + 
  scale_y_continuous('', limits = c(0, 5500))
pdp$set.feature("season")
p3 = ggplot(pdp$results) + 
  geom_col(aes(x = season, y = .value), width = 0.3) + 
  scale_x_discrete('Season') + 
  scale_y_continuous('', limits = c(0, 5500))
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3)

# Thoughts on Partial Dependence Plots

**Advantages**

- Easy to interpret (if features are not correlated):
  - "The partial dependence plot shows how the average prediction in your dataset changes when the j-th feature is changed."
  
- Easy to implement

**Disadvantages**

- Difficult to visualize more than 2 features

- Over interpret regions with not much data if the predictor distributions are not included on the plot

- If features are correlated, the interpretation is not so simple

# Individual Conditional Expectation .tiny[[Goldstein et. al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6392.pdf)]

**Purpose**: Similar to partial dependence plots, but consider each observation separately instead of taking an average.

**Estimated individual conditional expectation function:**

$$\hat{f}^{(i)}_{x_{int}}(x_{int})=\hat{f}(x_{int},x^{(i)}_{other})$$

- $\hat{f}=$ machine learning model fit using predictor variables 
- $x_{int}=$ value of the predictor of interest
- $x^{(i)}_{other}=$ vector of training data values of other predictors in the model for observation $i$

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 2.5}
# Based on code from Molnar's IML GitHub repo
ice = FeatureEffect$new(bike_pred, "temp", method = "ice")

# Centered ICE Plots

"Sometimes it can be hard to tell whether the ICE curves differ between individuals because they start at different predictions. A simple solution is to center the curves at a certain point in the feature and display only the difference in the prediction to this point." - Molnar 

.left-code[
```{r echo = TRUE}
# Center the ICE function for 
# temperature at the 
# minimum temperature and 
# include the pdp
ice2 = FeatureEffect$new(
  predictor = bike_pred,
  feature = "temp",
  center.at = min(bike$temp),
  method = "pdp+ice")

# Create the plot
ice2_plt = ice2$plot()
```

# Thoughts on ICE Plots

**Advantages**

- Intuitive to interpret (if features are not correlated) 

- Easy to implement

**Disadvantages**

- Difficult to visualize more than 1 feature

- Over interpret regions with not much data if the predictor distributions are not included on the plot

- If features are correlated, the interpretation is not so simple

- Overcrowding with too many observations

# Concerns with counterfactual examples

Laugel et. al. (2019) paper:

"Several troublesome issues have been identified: [Baehrens et al., 2010] e.g. notice that modeling the decision function of a black-box classifier with a surrogate model trained on generated instances can result in explanation vectors that point in the wrong directions in some areas of the feature space in a trivial problem. The stability of post-hoc explainer systems has been criticized as well, showing that some of these approaches are locally not stable enough [Alvarez Melis and Jaakkola, 2018] or on the contrary too stable and thus not locally accurate enough [Laugel et al., 2018b]."
