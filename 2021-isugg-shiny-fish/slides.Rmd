# Invasive Carp

.pull-left[
Information from [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/miss/learn/nature/ascarpover.htm): 

- Native to Europe and Asia

- Brought to US in 1970's "to control algae, weed, and parasite growth in aquatic farms, weeds in canal systems, and as one form of sewage treatment"

- Now a problem in Mississippi River basin:

  - Threaten native fish populations
  - May lower water quality
  - Can endanger boaters by jumping out of water
