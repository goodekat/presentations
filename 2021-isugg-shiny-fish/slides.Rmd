# Background on Invasive Carp

# Invasive Carp

.pull-left[
Information from [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/miss/learn/nature/ascarpover.htm): 

- Native to Europe and Asia

- Brought to US in 1970's "to control algae, weed, and parasite growth in aquatic farms, weeds in canal systems, and as one form of sewage treatment"

- Escaped into wild and reproduced

- Become a problem in Mississippi River basin:

  - Threaten native fish populations
  - May lower water quality
  - Possible danger to boaters

# Current Management

- Federal and state agencies monitor and try to manage invasive carp populations to: 

  - Control population
  - Keep out of new aquatic ecosystems (include Great Lakes)

- Management practices from [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/ecosystems/invasive-species-program/science/asian-carp?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)

# Egg Collection

<br>

- One method for monitoring carp is to collect eggs

- Common practice is to have eggs identified using genetic analysis

- Both expensive and timely 

- Led Camacho et al (2019) to try using machine learning to classify fish eggs using egg measurements
