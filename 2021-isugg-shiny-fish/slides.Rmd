# Background on Invasive Carp

---

# Invasive Carp

.pull-left[
Information from [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/miss/learn/nature/ascarpover.htm): 

- Native to Europe and Asia

- Brought to US in 1970's "to control algae, weed, and parasite growth in aquatic farms, weeds in canal systems, and as one form of sewage treatment"

- Escaped into wild

- Become a problem in Mississippi River basin:

  - Threaten native fish populations
  - May lower water quality
  - Possible danger to boaters

# Management of Carp

- Federal and state agencies monitor and try to manage invasive carp populations to: 

  - Control population
  - Keep out of new aquatic ecosystems (include Great Lakes)

- Management practices from [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/ecosystems/invasive-species-program/science/asian-carp?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)

```{r out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/management-practices.png")
```

---

# Egg Collection

<br>

- One method for monitoring carp is to collect eggs

- Common practice is to have eggs identified using genetic analysis

- Both expensive and timely 

- Led Camacho et al (2019) to try using machine learning to classify fish eggs

# Overview of Random Forests

.pull-left[
**[Camacho et al. (2019)](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nafm.10380)**

- Trained random forests 

- Predictor variables: egg characteristics

- Responses: taxonomy levels (family, genus, species)

- Models showed promise for identifying invasive carp 

]

.pull-right[

**[Goode et al. (submitted manuscript)](https://github.com/goodekat/carp-egg-rf-validation)**

- Validated models using a new year of data

- Trained new models with all years of data

# Egg Collection

Collected eggs were taken to the lab for measurements and genetic identification

```{r out.width = "45%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/Larval_Tow_Eggs.jpg")
```

# Predictor Variables

.left-code[
**Egg characteristics: ** 

- Month
- Julian day  
- Water temperature	 
- Water conductivity  	
- Deflated?	 
- Pigment?  
- Compact or diffuse?  	
- Sticky debris?  
- Egg stage  
- Membrane average  
- Membrane standard deviation  
- Membrane coefficient of variation  
- Yolk average
- Yolk standard deviation  
- Yolk coefficient of variation
- Yolk to membrane ratio
- Larval length

# Response Variables

.pull-left[

**Taxonomy**: 

- Genus (17 levels)

- Species (29 levels)

<br> 

**Taxonomy with invasive carp categorized as on class**: 

- Family (8 levels)

- Genus (16 levels)

- Species (27 levels)

# Shiny App

---

# WhoseEgg

**Goal**

- Provide a tool for easily predicting the identification of fish eggs using the random forests

- Used to help identify areas where invasive carp are reproducing

<br>

**Audience**

- Scientists and natural resource management organization employees

- Many non-R users

- Users in upper Mississippi River basin (possibly other regions)

<br>

**Models used**

- Random forests for predicting family, genus, and species with invasive carp grouped

---

# Feedback from Audience

**Current version:**

- Version 1 of app (almost complete)

- Have ideas for improvement

- Would be great to hear thoughts!

<br>

**For example:**

- Suggestions to make more user friendly

- Data input process?

- What else to look at with predictions within the app?

- Advice for instructions?

- Organizing help page?

---

# App Demonstration

```{r out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/app.png")
```

---

# Plans for Adding to the App

Version 2: 

- Add visualizations of input data compared to training data

- Include prediction intervals

<br>

Version 3: 

- Add visualizations relating to explainability for individual predictions

- Add video showing how to use the app

- Add image during loading of swimming fish
