# What is Shiny?

Shiny lets you create apps using R!

From the [Shiny website](https://shiny.rstudio.com/): 

> Shiny is an R package that **makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R**. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.

# Project Background

# Invasive Carp

- Brought to US in 1960s

- Become a threat to native fish populations in Mississippi River basin

- Interest in monitoring population to prevent further spread

<br>

```{r out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/large-carp.JPG")
```

---

# Egg Collection

- One method for monitoring carp is to collect eggs

- Common practice is to have eggs identified using genetic analysis

- Expensive

- Led [Camacho et al. (2019)](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nafm.10380) to try using machine learning to classify fish eggs

# Machine Learning Appraoch

.pull-left[
**[Camacho et al. (2019)](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nafm.10380)**

- Trained random forests 

- Predictor variables: 
  - Egg characteristics

- Responses: 
  - Family, genus, and species

- Models showed promise for identifying invasive carp 

]

.pull-right[

**[Goode et al. (2021)](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nafm.10616)**

- Validated models using a new year of data

- Trained new models with all years of data

# Sampling Site and Years

Three years of collection

```{r out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/map.png")
```

---

# Egg Collection

Collected eggs measured and genetically identified

```{r out.width = "47%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/Larval_Tow_Eggs.jpg")
```

---

# Predictor Variables

.left-code[
**Egg characteristics: ** 

- Month
- Julian day  
- Water temperature	 
- Water conductivity  	
- Deflated?	 
- Pigment?  
- Compact or diffuse?  	
- Sticky debris?  
- Egg stage  
- Membrane average  
- Membrane standard deviation  
- Membrane coefficient of variation  
- Embryo average
- Embryo standard deviation  
- Embryo coefficient of variation
- Embryo to membrane ratio
- Larval length

# Response Variables

.pull-left[

**Taxonomy with invasive carp categorized as one class**: 

- Family (8 levels)

- Genus (16 levels)

- Species (27 levels)

# WhoseEgg App

---

# WhoseEgg

**Goals**

- Provide a tool that is accessible to non-R users for using the random forest to predicting the identification of fish eggs

- Used to help identify areas where invasive carp are reproducing

- Screen eggs to select a subset to send for genetic identification

<br>

**Models used**

- Random forests:

  - Trained with all three years of data
  
  - Responses of family, genus, and species with invasive carp grouped

---

# App Demonstration

App available at: https://whoseegg.stat.iastate.edu/  

Example datasets available at: https://github.com/goodekat/presentations/blob/master/2021-lunchinatoRs-shiny-fish/example_data.zip

```{r out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/app.png")
```

---

name: mylastslide

# Possible Updates

<br>

- Add visualizations of input data compared to training data

<br>

- Include prediction intervals

<br>

- Add visualizations relating to explainability for individual predictions

<br>

- Add video showing how to use the app

<br>

- Add image during loading of swimming fish
