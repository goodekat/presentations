# What is Shiny?

Lets you create apps using R!

From the [Shiny website](https://shiny.rstudio.com/): 

> Shiny is an R package that **makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R**. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.

# Project Background

# Invasive Carp

.pull-left[

- Brought to US in 1960s

- Escaped into wild

- Threat to native fish populations in Mississippi River basin

- Interest in monitoring populations to prevent further spread

]

.pull-right[

# Egg Collection

<br>

- One method for monitoring carp is to collect eggs

- Common practice is to have eggs identified using genetic analysis

- Expensive

- Led Camacho et al (2019) to try using machine learning to classify fish eggs

<br>

# Machine Learning Appraoch

.pull-left[
**[Camacho et al. (2019)](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nafm.10380)**

- Trained random forests 

- Predictor variables: 
  - egg characteristics

- Responses: 
  - family, genus, and species

- Models showed promise for identifying invasive carp 

]

.pull-right[

**[Goode et al. (2021)](https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nafm.10616)**

- Validated models using a new year of data

- Trained new models with all years of data

# Sampling Site and Years

Three years of collection

```{r out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/map.png")
```

---

# Egg Collection

Collected eggs were taken to the lab for measurements and genetic identification

```{r out.width = "45%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/Larval_Tow_Eggs.jpg")
```

# Predictor Variables

.left-code[
**Egg characteristics: ** 

- Month
- Julian day  
- Water temperature	 
- Water conductivity  	
- Deflated?	 
- Pigment?  
- Compact or diffuse?  	
- Sticky debris?  
- Egg stage  
- Membrane average  
- Membrane standard deviation  
- Membrane coefficient of variation  
- Yolk average
- Yolk standard deviation  
- Yolk coefficient of variation
- Yolk to membrane ratio
- Larval length  
]

# Response Variables

.pull-left[

**Taxonomy**: 

- Genus (17 levels)

- Species (29 levels)

<br> 

**Taxonomy with invasive carp categorized as on class**: 

- Family (8 levels)

- Genus (16 levels)

- Species (27 levels)

# Metrics on Training Data

Models trained with 2014-2015 and 2014-2016 data

```{r out.width = "95%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/train-res.png")
```

# Validation of Original Models

Metrics computed using 2014-2015 model on 2016 data

# WhoseEgg App

---

# WhoseEgg

**Goal**

- Provide a tool for easily predicting the identification of fish eggs using the random forests

- Used to help identify areas where invasive carp are reproducing

<br>

**Models used**

- Random forests:

  - trained all three years of data
  
  - responses of family, genus, and species with invasive carp grouped

---

# App Demonstration

App available at: https://whoseegg.stat.iastate.edu/

```{r out.width = "95%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("figures/app.png")
```

---

name: mylastslide

# Possible Updates

- Add visualizations of input data compared to training data

- Include prediction intervals

- Add visualizations relating to explainability for individual predictions

- Add video showing how to use the app

- Add image during loading of swimming fish
